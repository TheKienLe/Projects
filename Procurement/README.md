# PROCUREMENT PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS DASHBOARD
The project includes two files: 
* [Dashboard.xlsm](Dashboard.xlsm): the excel file showing the perfomance of the procurement team and individual employee
* [Report.pptx](Report.pptx): The ppt file that present our analysis and recommended methodology to enhance the procurement team performance

## Dataset
There are two dataset file which are the [PR Record.xlsm](PR Record.xlsm) (Purchasing Requisition) and [PO Record.xlsm](PO Record.xlsm) (Purchasing Requisition). These data showcase the process within the Procurement department and also the problem with current team's performance, where there are high rate of pending among these requests. By exploring the insight of the data, we could able to not only build the comprehensive and real-time dashboard for the company, but also come up with the solution, and direction to boost the team performance.

## The Procurement process
The procurement process involves the following steps:
* Purchasing Request Submission: The Procurement team receive purchasing request from various department and may be the procurement team per se. These requests outline the required items or serviced with specific requirement, if neccessary.
* Processing Requesst and Generating Purchase Orders: The Procurement team works on the requests to assess whether or not they are approved. The team then create the purchase orders based on the approved request and send to the respective suppliers.
* Monitoring Deadlines: Thoughout the process, both PRs and PO have the deadlines. If either the PR or PO request exceed the due date without completion, they are categorized as PR Pending and PO Pending respectively.

## Methodology
Tools: VBA, Excel
Method: ABC Analysis, Linear Programming, Data Analyst.

# Key findings
We have identified three key components that contribute to the team problems:
* Purchased Materials: Our purchasing team faces challenges in meeting the demand for highly fluctuated and seasonal materials. These materials require special attention and coordination to ensure timely fulfillment.
* Purchasing Employees: We have observed an imbalance in the allocation of purchasing requests among employees. Some individuals handle a heavy workload, while others seem to have a lighter load. This disparity needs to be addressed to ensure a fair distribution of responsibilities.
* Suppliers: To improve our procurement processes, we have conducted a thorough evaluation of our suppliers based on their performance. This evaluation helps us make informed decisions on whether to continue our partnerships or seek alternative suppliers.
* By addressing these three components, we aim to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of our procurement team, ensuring better management of purchased materials, fair distribution of workload among employees, and strategic supplier selection
