# Maximization Framework for Signed Social Networks by Signed-PageRank

In this project, we have developed a powerful maximization framework specifically designed for analyzing signed social networks using the Signed-PageRank algorithm. Signed social networks capture positive and negative relationships among individuals, providing valuable insights into complex social dynamics.

Our framework aims to maximize positive connections within the network while minimizing negative interactions. By leveraging the robustness of the Signed-PageRank algorithm, we effectively identify influential nodes that play crucial roles in shaping the network structure and interactions.

Using the Signed-PageRank algorithm, an adaptation of the traditional PageRank algorithm, we calculated importance scores for each node that account for both positive and negative relationships. This unique approach allows us to identify influential individuals and strategically allocate resources to maximize positive connections, enhancing collaboration, trust, and cooperation within the social network.

By developing this maximization framework, we offer a powerful tool for understanding and optimizing the dynamics of signed social networks. This framework has wide-ranging applications, including improving team dynamics, fostering positive online communities, and enhancing decision-making processes within social networks.

Our project contributes to the field by providing a comprehensive and effective approach to leverage the potential of signed social networks. Through this maximization framework, we empower organizations and communities to harness the power of positive connections and foster healthier and more productive social interactions.
